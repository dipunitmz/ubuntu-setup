What to do now (Before Reboot)
  Create a password: Enter a simple password (e.g., 12345678).
  Confirm it: Type it again when asked.
Write it down: You will need to type this exact password in a blue screen after you restart.

What to do after you Reboot (The Blue Screen)
  When your computer restarts, a blue screen titled "Perform MOK management" will appear. Note: You only have about 10 seconds to press a key before it continues to boot normally, so be ready!
  Press any key to enter the menu.
  Select Enroll MOK and press Enter.
  Select Continue.
  Select Yes when asked "Enroll the key(s)?".
  Enter the password you just created (e.g., 12345678).
  Note: The screen will stay blank as you type (no stars/dots). Just type it and hit Enter.
  Select Reboot.
